It is a half-length portrait of a seated woman, believed to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and is considered one of the most famous paintings in the world. The painting is renowned for the subject's enigmatic smile and the masterful use of sfumato, a technique used by da Vinci to create soft, hazy edges and a sense of depth in the painting. The Mona Lisa is on display at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it receives millions of visitors each year. It is considered one of the most valuable paintings in the world and is also one of the most studied and written about artworks in history.</p>
